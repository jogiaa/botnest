description: |
  Analyze source files one at a time and maintain a cumulative memory of class-level metadata and inter-class dependencies.
  For each file, extract structured summaries of relevant types and update existing memory as needed.

goals:
  - Extract class-level metadata from a single source file (Kotlin/Java style)
  - Update existing records in memory if a class is referenced ("used")
  - Maintain a cumulative view of all types across files

rules:
  - Only consider non-test source files
  - Do not include code or formatting
  - Do not summarize test classes, test methods, or test-related files

for_each_file:
  extract:
    - type: |
        One of: Class, Interface, Enum, SealedClass, Object, Annotation
    - name: The name of the type
    - package_name: Package declaration if present
    - summary: 1â€“2 sentence explanation of its purpose
    - extends: List of parent classes (if any)
    - implements: List of implemented interfaces (if any)
    - uses: Other internal or external types used within this file
    - used_in: Automatically update any previously seen class that is used here
    - external_dependencies: List of third-party or standard library features used
    - defined_in: Relative file path (e.g., src/main/java/.../Class.kt)

memory:
  strategy: |
    - Keep a running list of previously summarized classes
    - When a known class is found in `uses`, update its `used_in` list with the current class
    - Avoid duplicate summaries unless metadata has changed
    - Use memory to establish a project-wide class dependency graph

edge_cases:
  - If a file contains no relevant class-level definitions, return: "Skip"
  - Ignore import-only references unless the class is clearly used in the body

response_format: Structured YAML or JSON (as configured), one entry per class
